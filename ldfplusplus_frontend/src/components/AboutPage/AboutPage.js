			<h3 id="happening-heading">The LUMS student body remains
			 deprived of a single platform which can streamline some very important tasks.</h3>
			 <h3 id="happening-heading">
			  Currently, a discussion portal namely LUMS Discussion Forum (LDF) exists where students
			   can post about their questions and concerns.</h3> 
			   <h3 id="happening-heading">However, due to the large number of members in LDF, 
			   it has become more of a formal place where only the most important issues are catered to.</h3>
			   <h3 id="happening-heading">
			   For instance, a student who posts about wanting someone to bring food for them from 
			   some restaurant without having to get it themselves might not get enough recognition as
			    someone who posts about a major ongoing issue related to campus accommodation.</h3>
				<h3 id="happening-heading">
				 However, if the post of the student who wanted food was in a portal which was specifically for
				  that type of request, it may get more serious and quick recognition. On average, someone who is capable
				   of delivering the food will see the post quicker than they will on LDF.</h3> 
				   <h3 id="happening-heading">But this is just one example 
				   of how LDF++ will benefit the LUMS student body over LDF. The instructor and course reviews
				    will be present in extremely organized sections and subsections where students can find all reviews of a certain course.
					 To plan get-togethers for sitting around on campus, or for a jog around the cricket ground, students 
					 can post on LDF++ in the separate get-together section, where other students can find that particular
					  post and join in. Similarly, students can post about donation opportunities, enrollment swap requests, 
					  events, and belongings they want to sell in their own separate portals. A major benefit of using LDF++
					   over LDF or any other group on social media is that students will not have to share their social media
					    profiles with the whole community.</h3>
